# expense-tracker

* Expense tracker app to just keep track of what you spend or bring in. I use this project to practice coding and to also practice more on my array methods, local storage skills and just utilizing webpack.
* Here is a live demo of the app : https://expensestracking.netlify.app/
* Simply type in the names of your income or expenses , and the corresponding amount and just click add transaction, it will calculate everything for you, like a bank account would do.
